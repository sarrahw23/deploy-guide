# Contributing to Deploy Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on community-submitted deployment guides. Whether you're fixing a typo or adding an entirely new platform, your help is appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution: `git checkout -b add-platform-name`
3. **Write your guide** following the template below
4. **Test every command** in your guide on a fresh project before submitting
5. **Submit a Pull Request** using the PR template

## What We're Looking For

- **New platform guides** (`guides/`) -- deployment platforms not yet covered
- **New framework guides** (`frameworks/`) -- framework-specific deployment walkthroughs
- **Improvements** to existing guides -- updated commands, better explanations, new troubleshooting tips
- **Bug fixes** -- broken links, outdated URLs, incorrect commands

## Writing Guidelines

- **Be practical.** Show actual commands, not vague descriptions.
- **Be concise.** Developers want to deploy fast, not read a novel.
- **Test everything.** Every command in your guide should work when run in order.
- **Use consistent formatting.** Follow the template below exactly.
- **Include free tier info.** Most readers are students or indie developers.
- **Add troubleshooting.** Think about what went wrong for *you* the first time.
